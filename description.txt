Security
Client’s security is one of our priority. We use password encryption to ensure your password is unclear when it transits to our server.


Cookie
We used the Jquery cookie technology to remember the username if the user check the « remember me » box. For security reasons, we decided not to keep the password in the cookie. Nothing is safer than your brain.
